KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
Keyboard Shortcuts

    Most of the commands and options in Cherrytree have keyboard shortcuts for those of us who are more comfortable using the keyboard than the mouse. All the menus also have shortcuts, those underlined letters you see in the menu names. (NOTE: You must have this option turned on in your desktop environment). Press <ALT> and any of the underlined letters to open that menu, use the up, down, left and right arrow keys to navigate the menus and sub-menus, and enter to select the option. All of Cherrytree's native dialogs also have these shortcuts and accelerators. So if you can't remember one of these shortcuts, but loath having to resort to the mouse, press <ALT> and the menu name shortcut and go from there!
    
    For those who don't want to take their hands off the keyboard when they're working, there's also an easy way to navigate between nodes. Pressing <CTRL>+<TAB> switches back and forth between the text window and the node pane. When in the node pane you can use the arrow keys to navigate, there are other shortcuts to enhance that listed below. You can also just start typing the name of the node you want to go to. Cherrytree will jump to the first matching node, moving to the next matching node as you type characters. Simply press <ESC> then <CTRL>+<TAB> again when the node you want is highlighted.

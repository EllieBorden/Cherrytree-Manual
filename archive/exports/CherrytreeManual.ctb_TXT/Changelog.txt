• added limit of 10 MB to embedded files. embedding larger files is not safe.
• implemented the possibility to open embedded files with double click or right click menu. the opened embedded file is saved to a temporary location and opened with an external application same as it happens for links to files. the temporary file is monitored for changes and if a change is detected, the embedded file in the cherrytree document is updated automatically. all the external applications used to open embedded files must be closed before closing cherrytree since cherrytree will delete the temporary files at quit (a dialog warns the user to do so at cherrytree quit time if one or more opened embedded files is detected).
• the embedded files have now the time of latest edit and the size visible in tooltip.
• added configurable option to have codeboxes expand automatically.

• added tooltip in find all matches dialog indicating the full node path.
• improved the tree in links dialog and node change father dialog: now the middle (or wheel) click works also here to expand/collapse underlying node and also the double click toggles the expanded/collapsed state. furthermore the expanded/collapsed nodes status is the same of the main tree.
• added menu item to open the directory containing the preferences files.

• the minimum required gtk version is now 2.16
• the single (but very big) new feature is a new data storage type, a sqlite 3 database (which is anyway a single file). Storing the old way (a single xml file) will be still available but probably not much used since the new storage type offers faster reading, faster saving and less memory usage. To the two old file extensions “ctd” and “ctz” (xml and xml 7zipped+password protected) were added “ctb” and “ctx” (sqlite and sqlite 7zipped+password protected)

Command Line Options

    You can start Cherrytree with a particular document opened from a terminal or console command line. You will have to include the full path do the document unless you happen to store it's documents in a path known to your system's environment. An example of this in Linux would be:
    
    cherrytree /home/rob/Documents/notebook.ctb
    
In Microsoft Windows it would be something like:

    cherrytree 'C:\Documents & Settings\Rob\My Documents\notebook.ctb'
    
     You can also have it open to a particular node if you know the node name by adding the '-n' switch. In Linux it would be something like this:
     
     cherrytree /home/rob/Documents/notebook.ctb -n Recipes
     
Or in Windows:

    cherrytree 'C:\Documents & Settings\Rob\My Documents\notebook.ctb' -n Recipes
         
     This would open the "notebook" document and immediately go to the "Recipes" node.
         
     You can get the currently supported command-line options by typing "cherrytree -h" in a terminal or console.

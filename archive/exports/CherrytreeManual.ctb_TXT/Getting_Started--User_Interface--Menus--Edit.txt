EDIT
Edit Menu

    Preferences <CTRL>+<ALT>+P: Here you set your default Cherrytree preferences.
    
    Undo <CTRL>+Z: Undo the last entry / edit. You can undo up to the limit you set in the preferences.
    
    Redo <CTRL>+Y: Replace the last undo. You can redo all previous undoes, limited to the amount of undoes you set in your preferences.
    
    Insert Image: Opens a file dialog allowing you to place and image at the current cursor position. See "Insert Picture" in the Toolbar.
    
    Insert Table: Opens a dialog where you can set some table properties, then places the table at the current cursor position. See "Insert Table" in the Toolbar.
    
    Insert File: Opens a system file dialog where you can choose a file to insert as an icon at the current cursor position. See "Insert File" in the Toolbar for more
    
    Insert Codebox: Opens a dialog where you can set the box options, then places the codebox at the current cursor position. See "Insert Codebox" in the Toolbar.
    
    Insert/Edit Link <CTRL>+L: Opens a dialog where you can create or change a link to an anchor, another node, a file, folder or URL. See "Insert Link" in the Toolbar.
    
    Insert Anchor: Opens a dialog where you can give a meaningful name to your anchor, then places it at the current cursor position. See "Insert Anchor" in the Toolbar. NOTE: You may have noticed that in this and the last three items there are two links, one to the item itself, and one to the Toolbar node. This is an example of the use of anchors versus just linking to a node. Use anchors when you want to be able to quickly jump to a particular place in a long node.
    
    Insert TOC: This inserts a Table of Contents at the current cursor position. Any text in the document that has been assigned the h1, h2 or h3 properties will become the links for the table of contents. If you're creating a node with a lot of text that's under different headings - like you may often see in web pages - use the h2 and h3 properties on section titles and use h1 for the main title. Cherrytree will create a table of contents with hyperlinked titles and headings.
    
    Insert Timestamp <CTRL>+M: This will insert a timestamp, a current date and time at the current cursor position. Very useful if you want or need to keep track of when something was written or entered.
    
    Insert Horizontal Rule <CTRL>+R: This will insert a "rule line" or horizontal separator of 45 "=" characters below the current line. Useful when you want to separate paragraphs from one another.
    
    Insert Special Character: You can insert special characters not normally found on the keyboard from this menu item. Select the character you want from the list and it will be inserted at the current cursor location. The characters can be changed, added to removed from the list. See "All Nodes" in Preferences to change the characters.
    
    Change Case: This menu item has three sub-menu options; Lower Case of Selection/Word <CTRL>+W, which changes all upper case characters in the selected word or words to lower case, Upper Case of Selection/Word <SHIFT>+<CTRL>+W, which changes all lower case characters in the selected word or words to upper case, and Toggle Case of Selection/Word <CTRL>+G, which changes any upper case characters to lower case and any lower case characters to upper case in the selected word or words.
    
    Enable/Disable Spell Check <CTL>+<ALT>+S: Turn on or off spell checking as needed.

    Copy as Plain Text <SHIFT>+<CTRL>+C: Copys the current selection as plain text, with no formatting.
    
    Paste as Plain Text <SHIFT>+<CTRL>+V: Removes any special formatting from clipboard text.
    
    Cut Row <SHIFT>+<ALT>+X: This will "cut" or remove the text in the current paragraph and place it on the clipboard. The text does not need to be selected, it only needs to have the cursor somewhere within the paragraph you wish to cut. You can then place the cursor at the beginning or end of another paragraph and press <CTRL>+V to paste it there.
    
    Copy Row <SHIFT>+<ALT>+C: This will copy the text in the current paragraph to the clipboard. The text does not need to be selected first, it only needs to have the cursor somewhere within the paragraph you wish to copy.

    Delete Row <CTRL>+K: This will delete the paragraph containing the cursor. The text does not need to be selected first, it only needs to have the cursor somewhere within the paragraph you wish to delete. Don't worry if you made a mistake and decide you want the paragraph back, simply press <CTRL>+Z or undo.
    
    Duplicate Row <CTRL>+D: This will make a copy of the paragraph containing the cursor directly below the paragraph. The text does not need to be selected first, it only needs to have the cursor somewhere within the paragraph you wish to duplicate.
    
    Move Up Row <ALT>+<Up Arrow>: This will move the paragraph containing the cursor up over the paragraph above it. Useful in lists where you might want to change the order of items in it.
    
    Move Down Row <ALT>+<Down Arrow>: This will move the paragraph containing the cursor down under the paragraph below it. Useful in lists where you might want to change the order of items in it.

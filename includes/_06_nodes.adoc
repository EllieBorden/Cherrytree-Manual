== Nodes

In computer science, a tree is a data structure consisting of nodes which are connected by edges. In the tree shown in <<figure-5.01>>, *my_book* is the root node. *Part 3* is one of three child nodes that belong to *my_book* and is also the parent node of *Chapter 6*.

<<figure-5.01>> might look like <<figure-5.02>> in Cherrytree, where the document name is the root node.

== Text

Cherrytree supports three types of nodes, link:#_plain_text[*Plain Text*], link:#_rich_text[*Rich Text*], and link:#_automatic_syntax_highlighting[*Automatic Syntax Highlighting*]. 

=== Plain Text

Plain Text is data stored in {ascii-chars}[Ascii] format. It is more portable than Rich Text and Syntax Highlighting, but does not support images, links, or formatting.

=== Rich Text

Rich Text nodes have the same functionality as Plain Text and can also include text style, size, and color. In Cherrytree they also allow objects, such as images, codeboxes, and tables. (See link:#_objects[*8. Objects*] for more details.)

=== Automatic Syntax Highlighting

=== Formatting

Rich Text can be formatted from the *Formatting* menu. <<figure-7.01>>

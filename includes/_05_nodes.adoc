== Nodes

In computer science, a tree is a data structure consisting of nodes which are connected by edges. In the tree shown in <<figure-5.01>>, "my_book.ctb" is the root node. "Part 1" is one of the three child nodes that belong to "my_book.ctb" and is also the parent node of "Chapter 1", "Chapter 2", and "Chapter 3".

<<figure-5.01>> might look like <<figure-5.02>> in Cherrytree, where the document name is the root node.

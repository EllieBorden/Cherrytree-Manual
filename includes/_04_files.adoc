=== Creating and Opening

Cherrytree opens to the same state as when it last closed or to a new document if no previous state exists. To create a new document, click "File" within the menu bar and select the "New Instance" option.

To open an existing file, click "File" and select the "Open File" option, then select a document and click "Open." Recently used documents can be opened more quickly by selecting the document name within the "Recent Files" submenu. <<figure-4.03>>

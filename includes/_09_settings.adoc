* *Tab Width* - Defines the number of `space` characters that a `tab` is equal to in width.

* *Insert Spaces Instead of Tabs* - Replaces one `tab` with a number of `spaces` equal to the number defined in *Tab Width*.

* *Use Line wrapping* - Restricts lines of text to the current viewport by forcing text to a new line. This does not break a line with `newline` characters and can be toggled as needed without compromising the line structure of a node.

* *Line Wrapping Indentation* - Defines the alignment of wrapped text compared to the original line. 
** *0* - No indention.
** *Less than 0* - Indents the wrapped lines to the right of the original line by `x` pixels, where `x` represents the provided number.
** *More than 0* - Indents the original line to the right of the wrapped lines by `x` pixels, where `x` represents the provided number.

* *Enable Automatic Indentation* - Aligns new lines with the indention of the previous line.

* *Show Line Numbers* - Displays a numerical index of the lines within the link:#editor[editor].

* *Vertical Space Around Lines* - Defines the number of pixels that separate lines of text.

+
NOTE: See link:#_formatting_timestamps[*Formatting Timestamps*] for a list of timestamp directives or visit the {strftime}[*strftime* documentation] by click the icon next to the timestamp setting.

* *Chars to Select at Double Click* - By default, double-clicking text selects the sequence of letters and numbers that are under the mouse pointer and are not separated by whitespace, punctuation, or special characters. Adding characters to the *Chars to Select at Double Click* setting includes those characters in a double-click selection.

==== Terminal Command 
The terminal command is a configuration required to execute code within Cherrytree. To configure a terminal, set this option to a command that executes another command within a new instance of your terminal. Use `<command>` as a placeholder for the command to be executed in the new instance.

For example, when a codebox is executed on the machine in <<figure-9.11>>, the following command is used: `start cmd /k "<command>"`.

[[figure-9.11]]
.Figure 9.11
{terminal-execution}

* `start cmd` - Opens a new instance of command prompt.
* `/k` - A command line option to execute the text that follows inside quotation marks.
* `<command>` - A variable which represents one of the language-specific commands that are defined in the link:#_code_execution[code execution] options.

NOTE: The language-specific command represented by `<command>` is determined by the language selected in the link:#_codebox[codebox properties]. If, for example, a codebox executed in <<figure-9.11>> is configured for python3, `<command>` represents `python3 <tmp_src_path>`.

=== Miscellaneous

==== System Tray

* *Enable System Tray Docking* - Closing Cherrytree minimizes the application to a background process which can be more quickly accessed from the machine's system tray. *AppIndicator* may be required to access Cherrytree from the system tray in Linux. 
* *Start Minimized in the System Tray* - Minimizes Cherrytree to the system tray on startup.
* *Use AppIndicator for Docking* - (Linux only) Uses the appindicator feature to provide quick access to Cherrytree from your system tray.

==== Saving

* *Autosave Every `x` Minutes* - Saves the working document every `x` minutes, where `x` represents the number defined in this setting.
* *Autosave on Quit* - Saves the document upon closing Cherrytree.

* *Number of Backups to Keep* - Defines the number of backups to keep. The oldest backup is removed when this limit is exceeded.
+
WARNING: This also applies to autosaves that run on a time interval. For example, if your application is configured to save every 5 minutes, Cherrytree creates a backup every five minutes. When the backup limit is exceeded, a backup is cycled out every 5 minutes.

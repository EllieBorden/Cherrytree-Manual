==== Text Editor

* *Tab Width* - Defines the number of `space` characters that a `tab` is equal to in width.

* *Insert Spaces Instead of Tabs* - When enabled, replaces one `tab` with a number of `spaces` equal to the number indicated in *Tab Width*.

* *Use Line wrapping* - Restricts lines of text to the current viewport by forcing text to a new line. This does not break a line with `newline` characters and can be toggled as needed, without compromising the line structure of a node.

* *Line Wrapping Indentation* - Defines the alignment of wrapped text compared to the original line. 
** *0* - No indention.
** *Less than 0* - Indents the wrapped lines to the right of the original line by `x` pixels, where `x` represents the provided number.
** *More than 0* - Indents the original line to the right of the wrapped lines by `x` pixels, where `x` represents the provided number.

* *Enable Automatic Indentation* - Aligns new lines with the indention of the previous line.

* *Show Line Numbers* - Displays a numerical index of the lines within the link:#editor[editor].

* *Vertical Space Around Lines* - Defines the number of pixels that separate lines of text.

* *Vertical Space in Wrapped Lines* - Defines the percentage of the *Vertical Space Around Lines* value that applies to wrapped lines.
+
NOTE: This will have no effect if *Vertical Space Around Lines* is set to zero.

==== Miscellaneous

* *Timestamp Format* - Defines the format of a link:#_timestamps[timestamp].
+
See link:#_formatting_timestamps[*Formatting Timestamps*] for a list of timestamp directives or visit the {strftime}[*strftime* documentation] by click the icon next to the timestamp setting, shown in <<figure-9.02>>.

* *Horizontal Rule* - Defines the text inserted for a link:#_horizontal_rule[horizontal rule].
* *Special Characters* - Defines the list of special characters to exist in the link:#_inserting_special_characters[*Special Characters*] submenu.

* *Chars to Select at Double Click* - By default, double-clicking text selects the sequence of letters and numbers that are under the mouse pointer and are not separated by whitespace, punctuation, or special characters. Adding characters to the *Chars to Select at Double Click* setting will include those characters in a double-click selection.
